##  Project Overview

The **Loan Analysis** repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`Loan_Analysis.ipynb`) for conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) and deriving insights from loan-related datasets. It appears to include a test dataset (`test_*.csv`) and may be designed to explore patterns, defaults, risk factors, or predictive modeling.
